You attach this script to a game object in the scene and then assign your directional light in the sun slot. What this script does is increase a value from 0 to 1 over the number of seconds we specify. This value defines a full 24 hour in game day where 0 is midnight, 0,25 is sunrise, 0,5 is noon, 0,75 is sunset. By default a full day and night takes 120 seconds as you can see. When the value reaches 1 we reset it back to 0 so that the next day can start.
